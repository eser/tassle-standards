# Events and Callbacks
Callbacks are extensibility points that allow a framework to call back into user code through a delegate. These delegates are usually passed to the framework through a parameter of a method.  
  
 Events are a special case of callbacks that supports convenient and consistent syntax for supplying the delegate (an event handler). In addition, Visual Studio’s statement completion and designers provide help in using event-based APIs. (See [Event Design](../member/event.md).)  
  
 **✓ CONSIDER** using callbacks to allow users to provide custom code to be executed by the framework.  
  
 **✓ CONSIDER** using events to allow users to customize the behavior of a framework without the need for understanding object-oriented design.  
  
 **✓ DO** prefer events over plain callbacks, because they are more familiar to a broader range of developers and are integrated with Visual Studio statement completion.  
  
 **X AVOID** using callbacks in performance-sensitive APIs.  
  
 **✓ DO** use the new `Func<...>`, `Action<...>`, or `Expression<...>` types instead of custom delegates, when defining APIs with callbacks.  
  
 `Func<...>` and `Action<...>` represent generic delegates. `Expression<...>` represents function definitions that can be compiled and subsequently invoked at runtime but can also be serialized and passed to remote processes.  
  
 **✓ DO** measure and understand performance implications of using `Expression<...>`, instead of using `Func<...>` and `Action<...>` delegates.  
  
 `Expression<...>` types are in most cases logically equivalent to `Func<...>` and `Action<...>` delegates. The main difference between them is that the delegates are intended to be used in local process scenarios; expressions are intended for cases where it’s beneficial and possible to evaluate the expression in a remote process or machine.  
  
 **✓ DO** understand that by calling a delegate, you are executing arbitrary code and that could have security, correctness, and compatibility repercussions.
